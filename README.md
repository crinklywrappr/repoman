# repoman

Tiny tool to query repology.org.

## Installation

Download the application from the releases page.

## Usage

```
$ rp -s starship --with-repo chocolatey --with-repo scoop
rust:starship-module-config-derive...  0/4 repos
starship.............................  3/20 repos

$ rp -p starship --with-repo chocolatey --with-repo scoop
|      :repo | :subrepo |             :name | :version |  :status |
|------------+----------+-------------------+----------+----------|
| chocolatey |          |          starship |   0.44.0 |   newest |
| chocolatey |          | starship.portable |   0.41.0 | outdated |
|      scoop |     main |          starship |   0.44.0 |   newest |

Create a config file at `rp --config`.  Here is an example file.

 "nix_stable"
 "linuxbrew"]
```

## Additional

I wrote this in an afternoon.  I had a vm with 4 non-language-specific package managers and wanted an easier way to query what was available, where.

After writing it, I realized it's small enough (< 150 loc) to be an excellent project for playing around with lumo, babashka, graal native image, etc.

This has already been accomplished with graal native image.

## Future plans

It may be useful to invert the information model, and have repoman determine what package managers are on the system automatically.  Configuration would then be to hide repos instead of adding them.
